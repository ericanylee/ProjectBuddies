# ProjectBuddies
Erica and Aini's app development project
This app will be a resource for people to find 'buddies' that they can talk and chat with whenever and wherever they want.

The details of this app are still being planned out, but we plan to utilize Parase as our data base and the back end development. 
Some data we will be needing include username, password, a friend group of each user, and chat history of the user.
